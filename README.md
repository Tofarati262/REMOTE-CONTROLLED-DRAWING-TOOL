# REMOTE CONTROLLED DRAWING TOOL

### This is a portable product that enables these high school students with a lack of upper body coordination to produce art with at least one art tool on at least 1 surface. Traditional whiteboards require manual writing and erasing, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient in fast-paced environments like classrooms, meetings, and design sessions. A self-drawing whiteboard automates this process, allowing for precise, repeatable, and programmable content display which aids people that are differently abled.
